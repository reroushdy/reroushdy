## 👋 Hi, I’m Reham (Hammie NaNa)

  I test things, break things, learn things, and occasionally make them beautiful again.

## ✨ About Me

I’m Reham — though some people call me Hammie NaNa, which sounds like a character who solves crimes inside a test suite.

I enjoy combining automation, analytics, and design thinking to create clear and reliable systems.
My work tends to live where structure meets imagination — the place where one well-written test can suddenly make everything make sense.

I’m currently exploring how to bring technical rigor and creative communication together in a way that feels…human.

 
## 🎨 What I’m Learning

	•	Robot Framework & Playwright for UI/API automation
	•	MySQL for structured data wrangling
	•	Tableau for visual clarity
	•	VS Code wizardry
	•	Inkscape for diagrams and design sparkles
	•	Building a personal website to showcase my automation work

## 🧰 Tech Stack (My Toolkit of Mischief)

	•	Data Languages and Logic 
	•	Automation and QA 
	•	Data Analytics and Visualization 
	•	Design Tools, Platforms and Test Execution 

## 💭 What I Care About

	•	Writing automation that feels reliable and readable
	•	Designing test systems that reveal truth rather than noise
	•	Using data to illuminate patterns
	•	Making technical work a little more elegant, a little more expressive

## 🔧 Currently Building

**🧪 QA Automation Lab (SauceDemo Edition)**

Crafting a fully modular, page-object based UI automation framework using Robot Framework, Selenium, and Firefox/Chrome runners.

Includes:

	- A polished smoke test
	- Functional suites (login, cart, inventory, checkout)
	- A full regression pack with its own master runner
	- CI/CD-ready structure for GitHub Actions
	- Traceability matrix + documentation
	
— basically my portfolio’s crown jewel in test engineering.

**📊 WNBA Stats Database (Data Engineering + SQL Project)**

A MySQL-powered analytics project where I:

	- Extract & clean basketball stats via Python
	- Build schema + ingest pipelines
	- Run queries for player/team analysis
	- Plan to automate validation tests using Robot Framework
	
It’s sports analytics… but make it tidy.

**📚 AI-Assisted Learning Framework**

Structured learning paths I created to level up across domains:

	- Hypatia’s QA Lab
	- Hypatia’s Data Studio
	- Hypatia’s AI Training
	- Hypatia’s Cybersecurity Lab
	- Hypatia’s Philosophy of Human Experience

A multi-threaded AI-powered personal knowledge system.

**🌐 Personal Developer Website**

A clean, dark-themed portfolio site built with HTML/CSS/JS.

Features planned:

	- A projects gallery
	- Contact + resume section
	- Live automation test demo hooks
	- Aesthetic that whispers: “I test things…but also I’m stylish about it.”

 
## 🤝 Collaboration

If you’re exploring QA workflows, data patterns, automation architecture, documentation design, or anything curious and technical — I’d love to chat.
