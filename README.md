  I test things, break things, learn things, and occasionally make them beautiful again.

## ✨ About Me

I’m Reham — though some people call me Hammie NaNa, which sounds like a character who solves crimes inside a test suite.

I enjoy combining automation, analytics, and design thinking to create clear and reliable systems.
My work tends to live where structure meets imagination — the place where one well-written test can suddenly make everything make sense.

I’m currently exploring how to bring technical rigor and creative communication together in a way that feels…human.

 
## 🎨 What I’m Learning

	•	Robot Framework & Playwright for UI/API automation
	•	MySQL for structured data wrangling
	•	Tableau for visual clarity
	•	VS Code wizardry
	•	Inkscape for diagrams and design sparkles

## 💭 What I Care About

	•	Writing automation that feels reliable and readable
	•	Designing test systems that reveal truth rather than noise
	•	Using data to illuminate patterns
	•	Making technical work a little more elegant, a little more expressive

 
## 🤝 Collaboration
