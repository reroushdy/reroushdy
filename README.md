#  👋 Hi, I’m @reroushdy or Hammie NaNa - my first name is -> reham <- 

- 👀 I’m interested in learning automation testing and data analytics.

- ✨ I am working on a website to display sample data/queries, data visualization and the fun part; quality testing the overall naviation of the website and processes used to ensure effective UI/UX. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use visual studio code, Robot Framework and Playwright for automation testing, mySQL for data analysis, and Tableau for data visualization. Inkscape is also a neat open source application I use to bring the message together and also utilizing some of my design sparkle. 

#  ✨My objective is to combine my technical and design skills to make a valuable contribution to a workforce that could possibly benefit from a little pizazz.✨

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ways to improve automation testing and data queries to increase the presence of a variable or concpt that might help solve a defined problem - your time and consideration is most appreciated.
