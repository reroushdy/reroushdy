## 👋 Hi, I’m Reham (Hammie NaNa)

  I test things, break things, learn things, and occasionally make them beautiful again.

## ✨ About Me

I’m Reham — though some people call me Hammie NaNa, which sounds like a character who solves crimes inside a test suite.

I enjoy combining automation, analytics, and design thinking to create clear and reliable systems.
My work tends to live where structure meets imagination — the place where one well-written test can suddenly make everything make sense.

I’m currently exploring how to bring technical rigor and creative communication together in a way that feels…human.

 
## 🎨 What I’m Learning

	•	Robot Framework & Playwright for UI/API automation
	•	MySQL for structured data wrangling
	•	Tableau for visual clarity
	•	VS Code wizardry
	•	Inkscape for diagrams and design sparkles
	•	Building a personal website to showcase my automation work

## 🧰 Tech Stack (My Toolkit of Mischief)

	•	Data Languages and Logic 
	•	Automation and QA 
	•	Data Analytics and Visualization 
	•	Design Tools, Platforms and Test Execution 

## 💭 What I Care About

	•	Writing automation that feels reliable and readable
	•	Designing test systems that reveal truth rather than noise
	•	Using data to illuminate patterns
	•	Making technical work a little more elegant, a little more expressive

## 🔧 Currently Building

🧪 QA Automation Lab (SauceDemo Edition)
Crafting a fully modular, page-object based UI automation framework using Robot Framework, Selenium, and Firefox/Chrome runners.
Includes:
	•	A polished smoke test
	•	Functional suites (login, cart, inventory, checkout)
	•	A full regression pack with its own master runner
	•	CI/CD-ready structure for GitHub Actions
	•	Traceability matrix + documentation
— basically my portfolio’s crown jewel in test engineering.

📊 WNBA Stats Database (Data Engineering + SQL Project)
A MySQL-powered analytics project where I:
	•	Extract & clean basketball stats via Python
	•	Build schema + ingest pipelines
	•	Run queries for player/team analysis
	•	Plan to automate validation tests using Robot Framework
It’s sports analytics… but make it tidy.

📚 AI-Assisted Learning Framework 
Structured learning paths I created to level up across domains:
	•	Hypatia’s QA Lab
	•	Hypatia’s Data Studio
	•	Hypatia’s AI Training
	•	Hypatia’s Cybersecurity Lab
	•	Hypatia’s Philosophy of Human Experience
A multi-threaded AI-powered personal knowledge system.

🌐 Personal Developer Website
A clean, dark-themed portfolio site built with HTML/CSS/JS.
Features planned:
	•	A projects gallery
	•	Contact + resume section
	•	Live automation test demo hooks
	•	Aesthetic that whispers: “I test things…but also I’m stylish about it.”

 
## 🤝 Collaboration

If you’re exploring QA workflows, data patterns, automation architecture, documentation design, or anything curious and technical — I’d love to chat.
